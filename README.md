A simple picasso painting created with CSS styling. Lots of CSS review. Only thing new was using "i" element to insert icons.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
This project was mostly review of known concepts. The biggest challenge was mentally tracking how divs would impact the css. Also, inline-block vs inline still trip me up a bit. They look visually similar. I believe the biggest difference is in how you can manipulate spacing (height/width) on inline-block.

<h3>Takeaways</h3>
Positioning elements is very useful. Absolute allows you to move an element outside of its normal position without filling in its space. Up until now I only understood how fixed and sticky work.
